# Norbedo - SvelteKit Project

Core Architecture:

- Svelte5 using runes based architecture
- SvelteKit app with TypeScript
- DaisyUI + Tailwind for styling
- Component-based architecture in src/lib/components/
- Routes in src/routes/ using SvelteKit file-based routing

Key Directories:

- src/lib/components/ - Reusable Svelte components
- src/routes/ - SvelteKit pages and layouts
- static/ - Static assets (fonts, images)

Main Constraints:

- Always use DaisyUI semantic colors (bg-primary, text-base-content, etc.)
- Follow Svelte 5+ syntax and conventions
- TypeScript for all logic
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Consistent component structure
