description: .mdc files describe specific rules for how certain files, file types, and directories are to be understood and used
globs: .cursor/rules/*.mdc

.mdc File Structure & Best Practices:

File Naming: NNN_name.mdc (NNN = 001-299)

- 001-099: Core/workspace rules
- 100-199: Integration rules
- 200-299: Pattern rules
  Higher numbers take precedence if rules conflict

UI Components:

1. Description (top)
    - Brief purpose summary
    - Appears in AI context

2. Globs (top)
    - Comma-separated list
    - Example: /dir1/**/\*,/dir2/**/_,/dir3/\*\*/_
    - Use standard glob syntax

3. Body Text (this section)
    - Keep under 25 lines
    - Use concise/shorthand
    - Tag files with @
    - Focus on key directives

Best Practice: The assistant may propose changes to .mdc files for the user to copy into the UI. The assistant should not attempt direct file edits to .mdc files.
